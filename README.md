# Graphics-based-Fighter-Game
In this game, players will use keyboard to control the fighter and there will be multiple enemy fighter coming from the top of the window. Both our fighter and enemy fighters can fire bullets. If enemy fighter gets hit, the fighter will disappear and get some scores. If our fighters get hit and the Hp less than 0, game will be over.

In the proposal, we want to design a two-dimensional fighter game that will use four advanced java technologies: GUI, Multi-Thread, Networking, Database. In our submitted code, we used these four advanced techniques to achieve the desired functionality.

Designed a ranking system to record the highest score of each player.
Implemented multi-thread and networking technologies to enable the server to response to the numerous requests from multiple players simultaneously.
